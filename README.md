Simple QB-Core gym script for PS-Buffs

A simple gym script for ps-buffs and ps-hud.  Use the config to place items into the gym.  

You can adjust buffs in client.lua .  Be sure to check out project sloth to learn more about this.

---------------------------------------------
If you want to change the animations, it is also done in client.lua   Use this dictionary or one similar https://alexguirre.github.io/animations-list/

---------------------------------------------
Important!  You need a gym membership for the you to be able to use the equipment.  Make sure to add to your shared/items.lua
 ['gym_membership'] = {['name'] = 'gym_membership', ['label'] = 'Gym Membership', ['weight'] = 0, ['type'] = 'item',  ['image'] = 'gym_membership.png',  ['unique'] = true, ['useable'] = true, ['shouldClose'] = true, ['combinable'] = nil, ['description'] = 'Gym Membership for Pump and Run'},

Make sure you add a picture to your inventory.  I have included one in the file.  Feel free to use your own.
