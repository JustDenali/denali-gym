Simple QB-Core gym script for PS-Buffs

A simple gym script for ps-buffs and ps-hud.  Use the config to place items into the gym.  


Replace powerade with drink of your choice

You can adjust buffs in client.lua

I also currently use nh-context, but will be switching to qb-menu soon.  


happy rp'ing
Please give me credit if you use this script and rerelease it.
